# Seeds

+ A connect the dots game where the user must gather many seeds.
+ An experiment that asks how can you use a UI framework like React to make games?

A demo working on gh-pages http://andrewmacmurray.github.io/seeds/

Goals:

+ [x] A browser based game using React and Redux
+ [ ] Different layouts and challenges for each board
+ [x] A level system where the user progresses through a hub world
