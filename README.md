# Seed

A connect the dots game where the user must gather many seeds.

![seed](public/img/seed-collection.png)

Rough demo working on gh-pages http://andrewmacmurray.github.io/seed/

Goals:

+ A browser based game using React and Redux
+ Different layouts and challenges for each board
+ A level system where the user progresses through a hub world

If you'd like to collaborate feel free to leave an issue on github.
